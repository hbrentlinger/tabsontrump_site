<p>We are living in a time when undeniable truth has become nearly impossible to come across. With a seemingly exponential increases in fake news and Donald Trump’s “Alternative Facts”, becoming an everyday occurance, it has become harder and harder to decipher what is true and what is false. The Internet has presented the opportunity for anyone to put misinformation out to the masses. This is only perpetuated through the use of social media and the bubbles that many of us choose to reside in. 
<p>
In a cluttered newsfeed tailored to our bias’, it is hard to full-heartedly trust anything that you read on the internet these days. Donald Trump, along with many other politicians and news outlets, are guilty of spreading misinformation to the masses. Through the use of his Twitter Trump has found a pedestal on which he can invent his own truths. This is an incredibly dangerous perdiciment considering that to many, his words are taken as truth. 
<p>
Tabs On Trump aims do just what it name implies,  keep tabs on the words our president is  putting out to the masses. We are here to call the president on his bluffs. We have taken the many “Alternative Facts” of Donald Tump and sorted them into a digestable interactive list. 
<p>
We want Donald Trump to know that fact is not up for debate. He does not have the sole authority to determine his own truths.
